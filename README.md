# CatsPersonalWebsite
Personal website for James the cat with contact form and searching tool for getting info about cat's breeds.

In this project I used firebase API to storage data from contact form. One more tool I used is BeautifulSoup library for parsing petfinder.com and scrape the data to display the data on response page. Routing is organized with Flask library. 
To run the project follow these commands:
python -m venv homepage
pip install Flask
and then run the app.py file
